This is a Python project that allows you to read data from .csv files, clean and analyze it using Pandas, and visualize graphs using Matplotlib is called "Data Analysis with Pandas."

This project utilizes the Pandas library to read data from .csv files and perform data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis operations. Pandas provides powerful data structures, such as DataFrames, which allow for efficient working with tabular data.

Next, using the Matplotlib library, the project can create various types of graphs to visualize the analyzed data. Matplotlib offers a wide range of options for creating customized graphs, including bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, and more.

This project is useful for data scientists, analysts, researchers, and anyone working with tabular data. It enables tasks such as data exploration, manipulation, cleaning, aggregation, statistical analysis, and visualization of results.

By using this project, you can easily read .csv files, apply data cleaning operations (such as handling missing or outlier values), perform statistical calculations (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.), create graphs to visualize trends or relationships between variables, and export the results in various formats.
